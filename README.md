Have you ever wanted to build your own team of Marvel characters?
<br>Have you ever thought about what these characters would say to one another?
<br>What would a comic scene between this group of characters be like?
<br>
<br>Worry not! That's what our app is here to answer. Search your favorite Marvel character and add up to 3 to form a team! Then add a quote to each character and write your own little comic strip. The quotes randomize each time you refresh. It'll be like a new scene every time!
